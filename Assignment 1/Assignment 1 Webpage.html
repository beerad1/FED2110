            <p>
                I'm a 25 year old North Carolinean, who is eager to begin a career in Front End Development. 
                I graduated with a degree in IT from the <a href="https://uwf.edu/">University of West Florida</a> in 2020, and I have been job searching since. 
                This was made more difficult due to the pandemic, but it did offer me time to explore many opportunities that I 
                may not have otherwise, which has ultimately led me here: to Quotum.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am very excited to begin my work here, and I hope that this webpage shows the current potential 
                of my coding abilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've been working in IT and IT related positiions since I was 8 years old.
                My earliest memories of working are going to job sites with my mother on the nearby 
                Ft. Bragg, to help her run Cat5 and 6 cables underneath old barracks buildings.
            </p>

            <p>
                More recently I worked as the Interim IT manager at the sister schools 
                Elk Mountain Academy and Clearview Girls Acaemy in Idaho and Montana, 
                respectively. The majority of my work consisted of managing internet safety
                policies for employees and students, as well as implementing new network devices 
                for the schools.

                My main hobby is playing MMORPGs. I love the feeling of community I share with other people in and out of game.
                More than that though is the feeling of challenge and growth I get from organizing large groups of people and
                overcoming great difficulties for no reward other than personal interest and satisfaction.

                My other hobby is hiking. I love going on long trips to remote places and spending a quiet day exploring with
                friends, family, or even just by myself. My favorite places to hike are the ones with a lot of personal history. 
                Going to Raven Rock reminds me of all the times my parents took me there as a child, and Ross Creek Cedars makes me feel 
                like it's my first time in Montana all over again.
